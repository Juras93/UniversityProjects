I never thought that creating applications in PHP could be so easy and funny :)

I want to create here few simple applications, and known better technology like node.js. Maybe there appear with my subjectifve comment.

Application with Node.js will be the newest application. 
I want to create shop or something like this, using Redux design pattern, and AngularJS.

Very useful materials for this applications:
- http://redux.js.org
